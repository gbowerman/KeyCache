# KeyCache
Windows tool to securely store passwords and secrets.

This tool is a password vault designed for saving personal passwords and secrets. It provides quick access to your passwords and AES-256 security.

When you run it for the first time, enter a passphrase twice, and add some records. When you close the app it will ask for a file location. Use a cloud drive like onedrive or dropbox to access it from anywhere.

There is an open file option for when you run it for the first time on another device.

KeyCache remembers the last file you used, so entering the passphrase brings up the records you have saved directly.
